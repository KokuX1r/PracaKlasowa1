                    <h1><strong>Healthy lifestyle</strong></h1>
                    <p>A healthy lifestyle is essential for maintaining physical, mental, and emotional well-being. It
                        encompasses a balanced diet, regular physical activity, sufficient sleep, and positive habits
                        that contribute to overall health. Adopting a healthy lifestyle not only helps prevent diseases
                        but also enhances the quality of life and longevity.</p>

                <h4>Healthy device-width</h4>
                <p>A balanced diet is a key component of a healthy lifestyle. Consuming a variety of fruits, vegetables,
                    whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats provides the body with the necessary nutrients.
                    Avoiding processed foods, excessive sugar, and saturated fats is equally important. Drinking plenty
                    of water keeps the body hydrated and supports essential bodily functions.</p>
                <h4>Exercises</h4>
                <p>Regular exercise is another pillar of good health. Engaging in physical activities, such as walking,
                    running, swimming, or yoga, helps improve cardiovascular health, strengthen muscles, and boost
                    mental well-being. Experts recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week to
                    maintain optimal health.</p>
                <h4>Health dream</h4>
                <p>Sleep is often overlooked but plays a crucial role in a healthy lifestyle. Adults need around 7-9
                    hours of sleep per night to allow the body and mind to recover. Poor sleep can lead to various
                    health problems, including weakened immunity and mental fatigue.</p>
                <h4>Mental health</h4>
                <p>Additionally, managing stress is vital for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Practicing mindfulness,
                    meditation, or spending time with loved ones can reduce stress levels. Avoiding harmful habits such
                    as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, or overworking also contributes to long-term health.</p>
